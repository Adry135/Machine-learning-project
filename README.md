# Machine-learning-project

In this machine learning project I ask you to train a single learning model (of your choice, as long as it has at least one hyperparameter to validate) and evaluate its performance.

You will have to comment on the code justifying the steps and choices you make.

This is a medical application: you will have to predict the level of disease progression after one year, starting from 10 variables measured on patients.
